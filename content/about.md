Hello, My name is Rohit and I am a quantitative data engineer at
[AlphaQuest f.k.a Quest Partners LLC](https://www.alphaquest.com) in New York, working on the Research Data Platform - which covers market data onboarding, new data processes, backtesting engine development, cloud infrastructure deployment, and all the little gaps in the middle such as ELT pipelines, internal tooling and database design and management.

My main languages at the moment are Python and C#, though I have been giving Go a "go" (had to take that one, sorry). Have also worked with Java and C quite a bit in the past.

As for Data Engineering - lot of Airflow, Snowflake, Jenkins, GH Actions, AWS (S3, EC2s, Lambdas), Python frameworks - Pandas, Numpy, Scipy.

I dabbled in AI quite a bit this summer - building out RAG using langgraph, MCP Servers, Agentic Workflows and so on.

In my free time, I like to tinker with and fix electronics, build small personal tools, learn new programming languages, run, play board games, and experiment with new technologies and infrastructure.
