Hello, My name is Rohit and I am a quantitative developer/software engineer/data engineer at
[Monachil Capital Partners LP](https://www.monachilpartners.com). Started off as an intern
in 2022, now working full-time. Recently graduated (Dec 2022) from my Master's Program at
[Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) and joined the "*professional workforce*".

My main languages at the moment are Python and Java. Started with C and C++, now we here. Still 
love C as a lang and think anyone new to programming should start with C. Sometimes like to try
out new languages on the weekend. I think Rust has some real potential!

Been learning a lot of new things recently, including but not limited to cloud engineering &
 architecture, finance and lending, dev-ops, best software engineering practices, parallel 
processing, concurrency and so on. Interested in anything technology, spend my free time
tinkering. 

As for what I do on a day to day basis at work - a lot of Pandas, NumPy, interacting with REST
APIs, cloud setup and infrastructure, building internal tools/libraries, implementing financial
models in code, and so on.
