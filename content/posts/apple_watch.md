Lately, I‚Äôve been thinking about selling my Apple Watch and switching to something simpler. Less smart, more minimal. Something that does not distract me with notification's unless I set it to one of the five focus modes that exist and I have to configure to allow certain app notifications to come through.


##### A little bit of when and why I got here
Right now, I‚Äôve got the Apple Watch Series 9, which I‚Äôve been using for about a year and a half. Before that, I had the Series 6‚Ä¶ lost it during a house move (wonderful).  

While they are really polished devices, packed with endless features like ApplePay, ECG, etc. - rarely do I end up using any of them. My primary purpose is to have a bloat free fitness tracker (I do like a screen so I can track my start/end/track my workouts as I am doing them) and maybe sleep tracking. You could get rid of all other inter-device connectivity, notifications, "wellness" features and I probably would not miss them. Not like the Apple Watch does a very good job of all these functions anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ - sleep tracking that barely works even though you have to turn on sleep focus MANUALLY might I say. Anyway, I won't miss using the tip calculator on my watch (very corny), or the three tries it takes to make a payment using the watch using ApplePay, at which point my phone has come out of my pocket anyway.

I realize it's become a burden at this point that I am no longer willing to bear. The digital noise it adds, the constant charging it needs, the dead weight it becomes when you forget to bring the charger on a trip. I can do without all of that - without losing much. I would rather wear a simple mechanical analog watch which does one thing well - telling the time while also having a lot more soul and heart. I have tried wearing both a normal watch and an Apple Watch on both wrists - and it's just plain goofy. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.

##### Where I am going
Maybe a smart band instead of a watch is the way to go. Something that still serves the purpose of a fitness tracker without trying to be a whole smart phone replacement on your wrist. I have used the Xiaomi Mi band before, back in it's Gen 2/3 days but looks like it has come really far, with the Gen 10 being the latest. It's also way cheaper than the Apple Watch at about $60, so there's less guilt in scratching up the screen - OR LOSING IT WHILE MOVING. **cough** **cough** 

Read this somewhere - *‚ÄúThe longer you spend in tech, the stronger the urge to buy a farm and never touch a computer again in your life‚Äù*

Well, maybe I am not quite there yet but I am looking to cut down on these gadgets which dictate and distract a lot of lives.

Maybe the first step is just... changing my watch.
